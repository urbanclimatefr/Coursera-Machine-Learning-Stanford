# Coursera-Machine-Learning-Stanford

This repository contains MATLAB Implementation of certain programming assignments of Andrew Ngâ€™s Machine Learning Course on Coursera, created by Stanford University.


* Programming Exercise 1: Linear Regression\
In this exercise, you will implement linear regression and get to see how it work on real world datasets.

* Programming Exercise 2: Logistic Regression\
In this exercise, you will implement logistic regression and apply it to two different datasets.

* Programming Exercise 3: Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks\
In this exercise, you will implement one-vs-all logistic regression and feedforward propagation for neural networks to recognize handwritten digits.

* Programming Exercise 4: Neural Network Learning\
In this exercise, you will implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.

* Programming Exercise 5: Regularized Linear Regression and Bias vs Variance\
In this exercise, you will implement regularized linear regression and polynomial regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties.

* Programming Exercise 6: Support Vector Machines\
In this exercise, you will implement support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian Kernels and you will be using support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifier.

* Programming Exercise 7: K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis\
In this exercise, you will implement the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image. In the second part, you will use principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.

* Programming Exercise 8: Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems\
In this exercise, you will implement the anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network. In the second part, you will use collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.
